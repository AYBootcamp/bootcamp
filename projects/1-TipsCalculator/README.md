# Tips Calculator

This is your first mini project. 

We will build on top of previous `TipsCalculator` HTML/CSS exercise.

Calculate the tips using user inputs and display them.

## Requirements

**Interactive**:
* User should be able to input values they like:
  * Total bill amount
  * Number of people
* User should be able to select the 5 available tip percentage by clicking the button
* Reset button should be enabled when any of the fields are entered
* Reset button should be disabled when non of the fields are entered
* When clicking on reset button, all of the user input fields should be set to 0
  
**Display**:
* Tip amount and total should be calculated (rounded to 2 decimal place) and displayed in their corresponding element

**Extra**:
* Bill and Number of people **can** go below 0, can you prevent that?
* Implement Custom percentage button, that will allow user to input their desire percentage.
